# DoLanguage
A fake programing language.

That's a lexycal exercise, to be an actual language it would need a parser, compiler, etc...

|Instead of|use this|or this|
|---|---|---|
|function|howTo
|if|is|?|
|else if|then is|??|
|else|then|...|
|for|do in|i...itemName|
|while|keep as|
|switch|what|itemName:|
|return|give|
|var|item
|const|const

## Philosophy
You are the wheelman. You do not say what to do, you do.
You are the computer, take the passive aproach and prioritize an active one.

## About "use this"

- howTo - When you define a function, you're actually giving instructions, when you call a function, you ask the computer to follow them.
- is - Think of yourself as the computer instead of the master, sometimes it makes more sense to think in the first person.
- then is - Same idea.
- do in - Giving priority to action here.
- keep as - As long as statement is true;
- what - What is the statement equal to? Then look for what to do in the instructions.
- give - more informal than return. Action asks for informality.
- item - phisical aproach.

## About "or this"
- ? - He's just asking.
- ?? - He's just asking again.
- ... - He gave up.
- itemName: - That's it, I believe you don't need to actually say it is a switch statement as long as it looks like a duck, if you know what I mean (duck typing is what I mean).

As I've said, this is just a lexycal exercise, it's not better or worse than any other language - after all, it's not a language at all, and even at that it doesn't have all the basics.
